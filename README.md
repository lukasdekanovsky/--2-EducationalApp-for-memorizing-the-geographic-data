# EducationApp
Written in Python, this application is dedicated to helping the user to memorize selected geographic data on a map.  
- As a user, we have the task of correctly specifying geographical locations, which, if correctly specified, will be displayed on the map. The remaining list of unremembered geographic data is generated in .csv format after the application is closed

- The application is written as universally as possible, so itÂ´s easy change geographical concepts, maps and areas, or to adapt the GUI to a specific user needs.
